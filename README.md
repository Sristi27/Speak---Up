## Elevator pitch
It is time for you to be the voice! Tell the world your story!

## The problem

Women, typically, avoid the harasser, deny or downplay the gravity of the situation or simply attempt to ignore, forget or endure the behaviour.

Humiliation is one of the primary reasons why women do not come forward to report sexual harassment or assault. Shame, lies at the core of intense emotional damage that women and men experience when they are sexually violated.

Women frequently **find themselves living in denial and minimising what they have gone through**. A comparison with someone else’s experience often leads them into believing that what they went through wasn’t a big deal. A friend and a former colleague once narrated, “I know a lot of women who have been abused by their closest family members, such as their cousins, or are assaulted during childhood. Being sexually harassed by friends or colleagues is nothing in comparison to what they had gone through. I have told myself to move on. There are far worse experiences than what I have faced.”

### Fear of repercussions

The fear of consequences is a massive hurdle women face when it comes to reporting sexual harassment or assault. The fear of losing their jobs fear they won’t find another job, fear of not being promoted, fear of losing credibility, fear of their physical safety and fear of being blacklisted by the industry are among the foremost deterrents.

Women are oppressed. They don't speak openly about their personal problems.There are so many women who have faced oppression and issues in their life. A lot of women need help with mental issues. Some women need financial help. Some women need jobs. Some need a friend to talk to.    

 Many women have bravely overcome their problems.

## What Speakup_Women stands for :

Speak up is a space for **women to support women**. This is a **dedicated platform for women centric growth, development and opportunities**. Women can speak about **mental, physical and financial issues**.

Speakup is a platform for women to talk about their personal problems, the issues they are **facing in their daily lives**. Women can **come forward with solutions to the problems as well**, along with resources that could help them. They can choose to be **anonymous**.

Physical issues like several cancers like **breast cancer and cervical cancer needs to be spoken of**. People who have suffered from it must given an opportunity to come out with their story so that **the next generation of women can safely tackle it**.

Financial : Women face discriminatio while applying to job posts. Here women can choose to write anonymously about their experience as well so that the world can know about the different issues women in the corporate world face.

## How we built it

Technologies used:
~ Express for Server Side Code
~ MongoDB Atlas as database support

## What's next for Speak-Up women

We aim to make more and more women aware of this platform and encourage them to speak up about the problems that they are facing in their day to day life. We aim to make their voices heard.
